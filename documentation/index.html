                <P>First we will prepare our <strong>Fees Structure</strong> for Current Session by configuring <strong>Fees Type</strong>, <strong>Fees Group</strong> and <strong>Fees Master</strong> then we will <strong>Collect Fees</strong> of students then we will understand and review various fees reports by using <strong>Search Fees Payment</strong>, <strong>Search Due Fees</strong>, <strong>Fees Statement</strong> and <strong>Balance Fees Report</strong>.</P> 
                <p>Lets understand how we will create fees structure in Smart School by using <strong>Fees Type</strong>, <strong>Fees Group</strong> & <strong>Fees Master</strong>. <strong>Fees Type</strong> means different types of fees can be collect by school e.g. Admission Fees, April Month Fees, May Month Fees, June Month Fees, Exam Fees, Dress/Uniform Fees, Library Fees, Sports Fees, Transportation Bus Fees, Picnic Fees etc. <strong>Fees Group</strong> Fees Group is use to make grouping of different Fees Type Then you can assign/allocate this Fees Group to whole class-section or a particular student. When you assign/allocate a Fees Group on a class-section or a particular student all Fees Type under this group with their Fees Master amount will be applied directly. You can assign/allocate multiple Fees Groups on a class-section or a particular student. Suppose we have created a Fees Group with the name Class 6 (2 Instalments) and added Fees Types Admission Fees ($1000), 1st Instalment ($5000), 2nd Instalment ($5000) then assign/allocate this Fees Group Class 6 (2 Instalments) on those students only who want to pay fees in 2 Instalments. You can create another Fees Group with the name Class 6 (1 Instalments) and add Fees Type Admission Fees ($1000), Full Instalment ($9500). You can also create another fees group with the name Class 6 Transport Fees and add Transport Fees as Fees Type and assign/allocate on those students who use transport facility. <strong>Note: Fees Type and Fees Group are not dependent on Academic Session but Fees Master is created session wise so you need to enter Fees Master data for every session.</strong>

					<li><b>Promote Students</b>- Go to <b>Student Information > Promote Students</b> select <b>Class</b> and <b>Section</b> and click on <b>Search</b> button to get student list under this class-section. Here you can see every student has Current Result column with Pass / Fail and Next Session Status column with Continue / Leave options and three drop down to select Promote In Session, Class, Section just above the student list. 
                        <br/><br/>Now let's understand how Promote Student works. Promoting students to next session and class-section depends on two things, 1). Student is pass or fail in main examination and 2). Student will be continue in school or leaving from school. If student is pass and will continue to school, only then student will be promoted to next session and class-section. If student is fail and continue to school then students will be promoted to next session but class-section will be remain as it is. If student is pass but leaving to student then student will not be promoted to next session nor promoted to next class-section. This is the whole mechanism of Promote Student. Smart School automatically manage promotion of session and class-section. To promote students first select Promote In Session, Class, Section and for every student select Current Result pass or fail and Next Session Status continue or leave and click on Promote button from bottom right.
