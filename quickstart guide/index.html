  <p>All of our items come with free support, and we have a <strong>Dedicated
                        Support Ticket System</strong> to handle your requests. Support is limited to questions regarding the code features, bugs or problems with the application. We are not able to provide support for code customizations or third-party plugins. If you need help with anything other than minor customizations of your code then you should enlist the help of a developer or our customization service.</p>
                <i>Please mention your <B>Codecanyon Purchase Code</B> with your support ticket.</i>
